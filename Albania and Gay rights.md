  The Marxists-Leninists are not conservative and fanticals, as the revisionists and the bourgeois charge. On the contrary, they are the most progressive people, resolute fighters against everything outdated and backward. They stand firmly on the positions of the new and fight with all their might for its victory.

Anticommunist myths come a dime a dozen. To retell a joke I read somewhere: "one can take any death toll attributed to Stalin, triple it, and call its originator a Stalin apologist."   
  
But unlike most such myths, "Hoxha's Albania gave 10 years for being gay" has no easy answer online. With any luck this short article will change that.  
  
Let us get to it, then.
# Albania and Gay rights - the easy answer
To begin let us ask, how bad was the situation there?  
Trick question. From 1977 the situation was very good. Then, Homosexuality was legalised not only for adults but for under-aged couples as well.  
  
In 1982, a Western initiative called "International Gay Association"(IGA, created a few years prior) launched a report about Gay rights in Eastern Europe. In it they proclaimed skepticism about the translation quality of the penal code - Because if it was true, [Albania would have had "the most liberal laws concerning homosexuality in the whole of Europe!"](https://cb65b51b-c150-4b9e-875d-05ed09f9e8c9.filesusr.com/ugd/90d4c0_2b1299dc69874002bc7690877e9d08df.pdf)
  
But what good is an unconfirmed rumor, you may ask? A year later this claim was checked again only to arrive at the same conclusion. To quote:

> In our June 1982 Eastern Europe Information Pool Report, we expressed doubts about the reliability of the available information concerning the legal situation in Albania. Further investigation has revealed, however, that Article 98 of the Albanian Penal Code is in actuality the only one concerning homosexual relations. The earlier Article 239 of the Penal Code of May 1952 (reproclaimed in March 1959) which provided up to ten years of imprisonment for ALL homosexual relations was abolished in June 1977. Thus, Albania does seem to have the most liberal laws concerning homosexuality in the whole of Europe. The age of consent is, therefore, at 14 for both homosexual as well as heterosexual relations.

-_[EEIP, 1983, P2](https://cb65b51b-c150-4b9e-875d-05ed09f9e8c9.filesusr.com/ugd/90d4c0_6e068484fbcd4a2b906ec0bfaf2b4d1d.pdf)_

It is worth noting that I found no reliable evidence of Homosexuals being imprisoned in Albania prior to 1977, either. Furthermore, Alfonso Casal pointed out that [in the USSR prosecutions under similar laws happened in cases of abuse rather then consensual relations](https://www.stalinsociety.com/news/homosexualityintheussr) lending credit to the idea Albania had a poorly worded law(caused by a poor understanding of Homosexuality back then) that in reality did not affect Homosexuals, and that in 1977 this poor wording was corrected. Then again in the case of Albania I have yet to find reliable proof one way or another to the situation pre-1977 so I will refrain from taking a stance.

  > So, in conclusion:  Lenin DID NOT specifically decriminalize homosexual activity. The Tsarist criminal code was declared null and void, the anti-homosexual statutes along with all the others. The 1922 and 1926 Soviet criminal codes did not mention homosexuality, but anti-homosexual laws remained on the books in the Islamic republics and Georgia. When homosexuality does re-enter the Soviet criminal code, prosecutions are relatively rare (1,000 per year out of a population of 200 million) and those that were prosecuted targeted instances of rape, child abuse, and abuse of dependent and vulnerable persons.

> Those are the FACTS. Was the law perfect? Of course not! Was it a good law or something to be admired or replicated? No. Was the law abused and innocent people sanctioned? Likely, as in all legal systems. But, the intent and extent of the law was far different from what anti-Stalin and ‘left anti-communist” propaganda would have one believe.

## If so, what is this myth based on?

  One of the troubles the Albanian party had to deal with was a practice called "Pederasty". The form it commmonly took in Albania was men aged 16 - 24 courting boys aged 12-17. There were numerous cases of men older then 24 and younger then 16 respectively. There were also cases of a disgusting practice of quote-unquote "marriage" being arranged in such cases. This practice existed at the very least in the early 1800s and continued well into the 20th century. It was done away with only due to the measures of the Albanian party of Labour.   
  
  In the [1977 Albanian Penal Code](http://ciml.250x.com/archive/albania/albanian/kodi_penal_15_6_1977_albanian.pdf), Articles 97 - 99 punish:   
  Rape by up to 10 years, at least 10 if it caused "serious consequences for health"  
  Intercourse with a girl below 14 with up to 15 years, at least 10 if committed "with violence"  
  Committing "Shameful acts" with anyone under 14 by 5 years.  
  
  
  "But wait!",  I hear you ask - "Does that mean pedophilia over 14 was legal? there was no law against it?" **Ridiculous.** Article 137, often falsely cited as an antihomosexual law, existed __exactly__ to prevent this type of pedophilia.
  
  > Pederasty is punished:
with deprivation of liberty for up to ten years.  
  
  Instead we are expected to believe the absurdity presented in the above question as a "yes". You tell me what makes more sense.   
  
  What does this mean? It means that Socialist Albania did not abuse teenagers with abstinence drilling, allowing young couples to do whatever so long as they consent, while keeping the pedos out. This law was not aimed at Homosexuals, it was necessary to protect teenagers after putting the age of consent at 14. To summarise with a few examples:   
  
  - gays or straights, 15 and 15 = legal
  - gays or straights, 25 and 25 = also legal
  - Child abuse with 25 and 15 = Criminal, Article 137.
