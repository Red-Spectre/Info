## Is China Socialist?
This can be answered by the question: _does capital exist in China?_

According to **Lenin** and **Stalin**:
> I have already advised you to turn for help to Engels’s book The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State. **_This book says that every state in which private ownership of the land and means of production exists, in which capital dominates, however democratic it may be, is a capitalist state_**, a machine used by the capitalists to keep the working class and the poor peasants in subjection; .while universal suffrage, a Constituent Assembly, a parliament are merely a form, a sort of promissory note, which does not change the real state of affairs.  
> The forms of domination of the state may vary: capital manifests its power in one way where one form exists, and in another way where another form exists—but essentially the power is in the hands of capital, whether there are voting qualifications or some other rights or not, or whether the republic is a democratic one or not—in fact, the more democratic it is the cruder and more cynical is the rule of capitalism. One of the most democratic republics in the world is the United States of America, yet nowhere (and those who have been there since 1905 probably know it) is the power of capital, the power of a handful of multimillionaires over the whole of society, so crude and so openly corrupt as in America. **_Once capital exists, it dominates the whole of society, and no democratic republic, no franchise can change its nature._**    

-_Vladimir Lenin, [The State](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1919/jul/11.htm), Lecture given in 1919._

>It is said that commodity production must lead, is bound
to lead, to capitalism all the same, under all conditions. **That
is not true. Not always and not under all conditions!** Commodity production must not be identified with capitalist production. They are two different things. Capitalist production
is the highest form of commodity production. **_Commodity
production leads to capitalism only if there is private ownership of the means of production, if labour power appears in
the market as a commodity which can be bought by the
capitalist and exploited in the process of production, and if,
consequently, the system of exploitation of wageworkers by
capitalists exists in the country._** Capitalist production **_begins when the means of production are concentrated in private
hands, and when the workers are bereft of means of production and are compelled to sell their labour power as a commodity. Without this there is no such thing as capitalist
production._**

-_Joseph Stalin, [Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR](http://marx2mao.com/Stalin/EPS52.pdf), P13-14_

And in order to confirm the existence of Capital:

> We know that the means of production and subsistence, while they remain the property of the immediate producer, are not capital. _**They become capital only under circumstances in which they serve at the same time as means of exploitation and subjection of the labourer.**_ [...] So long, therefore, as the labourer can accumulate for himself — and this **_he can do so long as he remains possessor of his means of production — capitalist accumulation and the capitalistic mode of production are impossible. The class of wage labourers, essential to these, is wanting._**

-_Karl Marx,[Das Capital Vol. 1](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch33.htm), Chapter 33_

Considering the fact China not only allows wage exploitation, But has [either the most or second most billionares of any country on earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_billionaires), It is safe to say Capital exists, Hence it cannot be Socialist.

To address some counter-arguments to this:  
- But they keep their Capitalists under control! / But they kill Capitalists! / But China is a DOTP!  
  - None of these is correct. 
  - We already established that Capital exists, We also established Capital _always_ takes control of _any_ state or society it exists in given enough time, _no exceptions._ 
  - It follows that China cannot be a Dictatorship of the Proletariat.
  - This argument will be given more detail below in its own category.
- its per capita!  
  - Irrelevent and dishonest. I brought up the amount the abundance of Billionares no because my point depended on it, But to point at the severity of the situation in China, to prove its not "young" Capital but rather already developed late stage Capital. In this situation it is impossible not to admit Capital has already taken control of society long ago. Using the 'per capita' argument tries to invalidate this position in the spirit of "They might be on that terrible list, And they might score high on that terrible list, But it doesn't matter because of this *other* terrible list they are on in which they are "only" above Brazil and Kawait and below the world average!"
  - They still have alot of billionares, Which have alot of wealth. And this fact stands. More on this below.
  - They still compare disfavourably in these metrics to India which by all accounts is capitalist.
- Its like the NEP!
  - Adressed below.

## Its Socialism with Chinese charactaristics! Its adapted to local conditions!

Socialism with Chinese charactaristics(SwCC for short) **does not exist.**
> You speak of Sinified socialism. There is nothing of the sort in nature. There is no Russian, English, French, German, Italian socialism, as much as there is no Chinese socialism. There is only one Marxist-Leninist socialism. It is another thing, that in the building of socialism it is necessary to take into consideration the specific features of a particular country. Socialism is a science, necessarily having, like all science, certain general laws, and one just needs to ignore them and the building of socialism is destined to failure.    

-_Joseph Stalin, [From the Conversation with the Delegation of the CC CP of China in Moscow](https://revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv16n1/china.htm)_

When taking into account the local conditions the end goal remains the same. If we wish to reach from B(beginning) to E(end), Regardless of what C(conditions) we have in the middle, We find a way to get past them(or utilise them if helpful) and proceed. We take into consideration C, Then set a course from B to E. In this case, We take into consideration national conditions(C), Set a course from Feudalism(B) / Capitalism(B) to Socialism(E) and reach the _one type of socialism **that is real.**_

Instead, SwCC _capitulates_ to the national conditions and nationalism itself, Declaring that due to C they will go from B to R(revisionism). This is not considering specific features or conditions but surrendering to them. This is not Internationalism, Not Socialism, But Nationalism.

The Marxist approach:  
`B -> E while planning for C`

The Nationalist, Antimarxist approach:  
`B + C = R`

Comrade **Stalin** was indeed correct when he stated:

>As far as I know in the CPC there is a thin layer of the proletariat and the nationalist sentiments are very strong and if you will not conduct genuinely Marxist-Leninist class policies and not conduct struggle against bourgeois nationalism, the nationalists will strangle you. Then not only will socialist construction be terminated, China may become a dangerous toy in the hands of American imperialists.

-_[Ibid](https://revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv16n1/china.htm)_

## But they kill Billonares! Why would a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie do that?

> A few more observations on fascist philosophy. They write as if they have socialism. This needs to be exposed in economic terms. This is what **Hitler** says: 'The State, The People! our capitalists receive only 8%. That is enough for them'! The formulation of this question needs to be accompanied by throwing light on the question of competition and the anarchy of production, with the attempts of the capitalists to get rid of competition with the help of the theory of ultra-imperialism. It must be demonstrated that they are doomed. _**They are propagating a corporativist system, as if it is above the class of workers and the capitalists and the State cares and looks after the workers. They are even arresting individual capitalists (it is true that Thyssen could escape).**_ One should say that in all of this there is more of demagogy, that _**this is just the pressure of the bourgeois State on individual capitalists who do not want to subject themselves to class discipline.**_ It should be mentioned once in the section on cartelisation and their unsuccessful attempts at planning. Mention it again in the section on Socialism. In your system, _**gentlemen fascists, to whom do the means of production belong? To individual capitalists and to groups of capitalists and, therefore, you cannot have genuine planning, except for bits, as the economy is divided among groups of owners.**_

-_Joseph Stalin, [Conversations with Soviet Economists](https://revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv4n2/5convers.htm), "On Fascism"_

In short, It is Bourgeoisie infighting, Using the state against individual bourgeoisie who break class discipline. It is the result of the centralised cartel-like structure of the CPC allowing their capitalists to be better coordinated, And to coordinate "class rules", And punish whatever capitalist breaks these "rules". Much like a DoTP would arrest individual workers for breaking the law(I.E a workers state arrests and executes a worker for taking an action that helps them individually but hurts the working class as a whole) can a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie arrest individual capitalists for breaking their agreements, Pacts, Concensus, Or even just because the wrong person stands to gain from their death(I.E a capitalist state arrests and executes a capitalist for taking a profitable action that hurts the capitalist class, Or a few other capitalists which are "stronger". Alternatively, The execution occurs because it would be profitable to this stronger group to do so).
