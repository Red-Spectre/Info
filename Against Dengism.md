## Is China Socialist?
This can be answered by the question: _does capital exist in China?_

According to **Lenin** and **Stalin**:
> I have already advised you to turn for help to Engels’s book The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State. **_This book says that every state in which private ownership of the land and means of production exists, in which capital dominates, however democratic it may be, is a capitalist state_**, a machine used by the capitalists to keep the working class and the poor peasants in subjection; .while universal suffrage, a Constituent Assembly, a parliament are merely a form, a sort of promissory note, which does not change the real state of affairs.  
> The forms of domination of the state may vary: capital manifests its power in one way where one form exists, and in another way where another form exists—but essentially the power is in the hands of capital, whether there are voting qualifications or some other rights or not, or whether the republic is a democratic one or not—in fact, the more democratic it is the cruder and more cynical is the rule of capitalism. One of the most democratic republics in the world is the United States of America, yet nowhere (and those who have been there since 1905 probably know it) is the power of capital, the power of a handful of multimillionaires over the whole of society, so crude and so openly corrupt as in America. **_Once capital exists, it dominates the whole of society, and no democratic republic, no franchise can change its nature._**    

-_Vladimir Lenin, [The State](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1919/jul/11.htm), Lecture given in 1919._

>It is said that commodity production must lead, is bound
to lead, to capitalism all the same, under all conditions. **That
is not true. Not always and not under all conditions!** Commodity production must not be identified with capitalist production. They are two different things. Capitalist production
is the highest form of commodity production. **_Commodity
production leads to capitalism only if there is private ownership of the means of production, if labour power appears in
the market as a commodity which can be bought by the
capitalist and exploited in the process of production, and if,
consequently, the system of exploitation of wageworkers by
capitalists exists in the country._** Capitalist production **_begins when the means of production are concentrated in private
hands, and when the workers are bereft of means of production and are compelled to sell their labour power as a commodity. Without this there is no such thing as capitalist
production._**

-_Joseph Stalin, [Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR](http://marx2mao.com/Stalin/EPS52.pdf), P13-14_

And in order to confirm the existence of Capital:

> We know that the means of production and subsistence, while they remain the property of the immediate producer, are not capital. _**They become capital only under circumstances in which they serve at the same time as means of exploitation and subjection of the labourer.**_ [...] So long, therefore, as the labourer can accumulate for himself — and this **_he can do so long as he remains possessor of his means of production — capitalist accumulation and the capitalistic mode of production are impossible. The class of wage labourers, essential to these, is wanting._**

-_Karl Marx,[Das Capital Vol. 1](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch33.htm), Chapter 33_

Considering the fact China not only allows wage exploitation, But has [either the most or second most billionares of any country on earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_billionaires), It is safe to say Capital exists, Hence it cannot be Socialist.

To address some counter-arguments to this:  
- But they keep their Capitalists under control! / But they kill Capitalists! / But China is a DOTP!  
  - None of these is correct. 
  - We already established that Capital exists, We also established Capital _always_ takes control of _any_ state or society it exists in given enough time, _no exceptions._ 
  - It follows that China cannot be a Dictatorship of the Proletariat.
  - This argument will be given more detail below in its own category.
- its per capita!  
  - Irrelevent and dishonest. I brought up the amount the abundance of Billionares no because my point depended on it, But to point at the severity of the situation in China, to prove its not "young" Capital but rather already developed late stage Capital. In this situation it is impossible not to admit Capital has already taken control of society long ago. Using the 'per capita' argument tries to invalidate this position in the spirit of "They might be on that terrible list, And they might score high on that terrible list, But it doesn't matter because of this *other* terrible list they are on in which they are "only" above Brazil and Kawait and below the world average!"
  - They still have alot of billionares, Which have alot of wealth. And this fact stands. More on this below.
  - They still compare disfavourably in these metrics to India which by all accounts is capitalist.
- Its like the NEP!
  - Adressed below.

## Its Socialism with Chinese charactaristics! Its adapted to local conditions!

Socialism with Chinese charactaristics(SwCC for short) **does not exist.**
> You speak of Sinified socialism. There is nothing of the sort in nature. There is no Russian, English, French, German, Italian socialism, as much as there is no Chinese socialism. There is only one Marxist-Leninist socialism. It is another thing, that in the building of socialism it is necessary to take into consideration the specific features of a particular country. Socialism is a science, necessarily having, like all science, certain general laws, and one just needs to ignore them and the building of socialism is destined to failure.    

-_Joseph Stalin, [From the Conversation with the Delegation of the CC CP of China in Moscow](https://revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv16n1/china.htm)_

When taking into account the local conditions the end goal remains the same. If we wish to reach from B(beginning) to E(end), Regardless of what C(conditions) we have in the middle, We find a way to get past them(or utilise them if helpful) and proceed. We take into consideration C, Then set a course from B to E. In this case, We take into consideration national conditions(C), Set a course from Feudalism(B) / Capitalism(B) to Socialism(E) and reach the _one type of socialism **that is real.**_

Instead, SwCC _capitulates_ to the national conditions and nationalism itself, Declaring that due to C they will go from B to R(revisionism). This is not considering specific features or conditions but surrendering to them. This is not Internationalism, Not Socialism, But Nationalism.

The Marxist approach:  
`B -> E while planning for C`

The Nationalist, Antimarxist approach:  
`B + C = R`

Comrade **Stalin** was indeed correct when he stated:

>As far as I know in the CPC there is a thin layer of the proletariat and the nationalist sentiments are very strong and if you will not conduct genuinely Marxist-Leninist class policies and not conduct struggle against bourgeois nationalism, the nationalists will strangle you. Then not only will socialist construction be terminated, China may become a dangerous toy in the hands of American imperialists.

-_[Ibid](https://revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv16n1/china.htm)_

## But they kill Billonares! Why would a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie do that?

> A few more observations on fascist philosophy. They write as if they have socialism. This needs to be exposed in economic terms. This is what **Hitler** says: 'The State, The People! our capitalists receive only 8%. That is enough for them'! The formulation of this question needs to be accompanied by throwing light on the question of competition and the anarchy of production, with the attempts of the capitalists to get rid of competition with the help of the theory of ultra-imperialism. It must be demonstrated that they are doomed. _**They are propagating a corporativist system, as if it is above the class of workers and the capitalists and the State cares and looks after the workers. They are even arresting individual capitalists (it is true that Thyssen could escape).**_ One should say that in all of this there is more of demagogy, that _**this is just the pressure of the bourgeois State on individual capitalists who do not want to subject themselves to class discipline.**_ It should be mentioned once in the section on cartelisation and their unsuccessful attempts at planning. Mention it again in the section on Socialism. In your system, _**gentlemen fascists, to whom do the means of production belong? To individual capitalists and to groups of capitalists and, therefore, you cannot have genuine planning, except for bits, as the economy is divided among groups of owners.**_

-_Joseph Stalin, [Conversations with Soviet Economists](https://revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv4n2/5convers.htm), "On Fascism"_

In short, It is Bourgeoisie infighting, Using the state against individual bourgeoisie who break class discipline. It is the result of the centralised cartel-like structure of the CPC allowing their capitalists to be better coordinated, And to coordinate "class rules", And punish whatever capitalist breaks these "rules". Much like a DoTP would arrest individual workers for breaking the law(I.E a workers state arrests and executes a worker for taking an action that helps them individually but hurts the working class as a whole) can a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie arrest individual capitalists for breaking their agreements, Pacts, Concensus, Or even just because the wrong person stands to gain from their death(I.E a capitalist state arrests and executes a capitalist for taking a profitable action that hurts the capitalist class, Or a few other capitalists which are "stronger". Alternatively, The execution occurs because it would be profitable to this stronger group to do so).

## What about poverty reduction?

Why does a country with more [GDP Per capita(I.E per person) then the USSR still have poverty?](https://wid.world/world/#agdpro_p0p100_z/SU;CN/last/eu/k/p/yearly/a/false/4.048999999999978/30000/curve/false/country)

Furthermore, Why does _rent still exist?_ both Dengists and Anti-Dengists have likely already grown tired of the "billionare" debate, But what about the Landlords?
Capitalists, Like under the NEP, Can "contribute" to society, Using the term loosely. But what do Landlords do except create poverty and raise house prices? Nothing.

Hence no self proclaimed Communist will ever try to justify the existence of Landlords, Or claim they produce anything. Allowing the existence of parasites who contribute nothing and hold homes for ransom is, By itself, Terrible. But what happens when a large part of society [_cannot afford basic rent?_](http://bj.cityhouse.cn/lmarket/) The average rent in Beijing at the time of writing is 7,485¥ per month. At the cheapest district in Beijing, Is [2,377¥](http://bj.cityhouse.cn/lmarket/my/). Around [11% of the city earns between 2,000¥ - 3,000¥ per month](https://salarycalculator.sinaapp.com/report/%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC), Taxes and basics not included. Another [12.5% earns between 3,000¥ - 4,500¥](https://salarycalculator.sinaapp.com/report/%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC).

The average Dengist will try to downplay this thing, Claiming "its not that bad!" or "other places have it worse!". The former is incorrect, The latter irrelevant(and probably incorrect too). Private rent existing in China, A developed country which - again - has more [GDP per capita then the USSR](https://wid.world/world/#agdpro_p0p100_z/SU;CN/last/eu/k/p/yearly/a/false/4.048999999999978/30000/curve/false/country) is by itself bad enough. How costly the rent just makes it worse.

## Isn't it just like Lenin's NEP?

No. To explain why not we need to explain two things about the NEP:  
**_What_** was the NEP, And **_why_** was it needed?

The NEP was a [strategic retreat](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1921/oct/17.htm) on the economic front. A sharp transition to Socialism was attempted due to the circumstances of the civil war and [invasion by foreign powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_intervention_in_the_Russian_Civil_War), When the USSR was invaded by Czechoslovakia, UK, [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Siberian_Expeditionary_Force), Australia, India, South Africa(latter four as U.K colonies), The [U.S.A, Italy,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Russia_intervention), France, [Japan,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_intervention_in_Siberia), Greece, Estonia, Serbia, [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War), [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_Civil_War) / [second source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viena_expedition), [Finland again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Karelian_uprising), Romania, [Lithuania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Wars_of_Independence), [Latvia backed by German soldiers,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_War_of_Independence) [Austria-Hungary, The Ottoman Empire, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Powers_intervention_in_the_Russian_Civil_War) and probably more. This is based only on bourgeoisie sources that aim to downplay such events.

This policy, According to Lenin, Failed.
> Of course, tasks on the economic front are much more difficult than tasks on the war front, although there is a general similarity between the two elementary outlines of strategy. In attempting to go over straight to communism we, in the spring of 1921, sustained a more serious defeat on the economic front than any defeat inflicted upon us by Kolchak, Denikin or Pilsudski. This defeat was much more serious, significant and dangerous. It was expressed in the isolation of the higher administrators of our economic policy from the lower and their failure to produce that development of the productive forces which the Programme of our Party regards as vital and urgent.

-_**Lenin**, [The New Economic Policy](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1921/oct/17.htm)_

The NEP was the correct line to fix these mistakes and work to _build_ Socialism. Emphesis on build.

#### There were a few reasons for its necessity, And we will go into some:

1) Large quantity of Peasants in the country, As it only recently freed itself from Feudalism.
> The New Economic Policy means substituting a tax for the requisitioning of food; it means reverting to capitalism to a considerable extent—to what extent we do not know. Concessions to foreign capitalists (true, only very few have been accepted, especially when compared with the number we have offered) and leasing enterprises to private capitalists definitely mean restoring capitalism, and this is part and parcel of the New Economic Policy; for the abolition of the surplus-food appropriation system means allowing the peasants to trade freely in their surplus agricultural produce, in whatever is left over after the tax is collected—and the tax~ takes only a small share of that produce. The peasants constitute a huge section of our population and of our entire economy, and that is why capitalism must grow out of this soil of free trading.

-_**Lenin**, [ibid](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1921/oct/17.htm)_

2) Abundance of small production and an absence of large scale production.

>  Let us enumerate these elements[E.D - Economic elements existing in 1921 Russia]:
(1)patriarchal, i.e., to a considerable extent natural, peasant farming;
(2)small commodity production (this includcs the majority of those peasants who sell their grain);
(3)private capitalism;
(4)state capitalism;
(5)socialism.
Russia is so vast and so varied that all these different types of socio-economic structures are intermingled. This is what constitutes the specific feature of the situation.

> The question arises: What elements predominate? Clearly, in a small-peasant country, the petty-bourgeois element predominates and it must predominate, for the great majority—those working the land—are small commodity producers. The shell of state capitalism (grain monopoly, state-controlled entrepreneurs and traders, bourgeois co-operators) is pierced now in one place, now in another by profiteers, the chief object of profiteering being grain.

> It is not state capitalism that is at war with socialism, but the petty bourgeoisie plus private capitalism fighting together against state capitalism and socialism.

-_**Lenin**, [The Tax in Kind](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1921/apr/21.htm)_

Because of this, Planning the economy was extremely hard and ineffective. Through State Capitalism the economy could function and set up the "apparatus" needed for Socialism which then takes over.

> At present petty-bourgeois capitalism prevails in Russia, and it is one and the same road that leads from it to both large-scale state capitalism and to socialism, through one and the same intermediary station called “national accounting and control of production and distribution”. Those who fail to understand this are committing an un pardonable mistake in economics. Either they do not know the facts of life, do not see what actually exists and are unable to look the truth in the face, or they confine themselves to abstractly comparing “socialism” with “capitalism” and fail to study the concrete forms and stages of the transition that is taking place in our country.

-_**Lenin**, [Ibid](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1921/apr/21.htm)_

3) Backward state of the productive forces.
In other words, It is not that the Bolsheviks "chose" Capitalism but had to put up with it as the only practical course of action they had.

>  What is the policy the socialist proletariat can pursue in the face of this economic reality? Is it to give the small peasant all he needs of the goods produced by large-scale socialist industries in exchange for his grain and raw materials? This would be the most desirable and “correct” policy—and we have started on it. But we cannot supply all the goods, very far from it; nor shall we be able to do so very soon—at all events not until we complete the first stage of the electrification of the whole country. What is to be done? One way is to try to prohibit entirely, to put the lock on all development of private, non-state exchange, i.e., trade, i.e., capitalism, which is inevitable with millions of small producers. But such a policy would be foolish and suicidal for the party that tried to apply it. It would be foolish because it is economically impossible. It would be suicidal because the party that tried to apply it would meet with inevitable disaster. Let us admit it: some Communists have sinned “in thought, word and deed” by adopting just such a policy. We shall try to rectify these mistakes, and this must be done without fail, otherwise things will come to a very sorry state.

> The alternative (and this is the only sensible and the last possible policy) is not to try to prohibit or put the lock on the development of capitalism, but to channel it into state capitalism. This is economically possible, for state capitalism exists—in varying form and degree—wherever there are elements of unrestricted trade and capitalism in general.

-_**Lenin**, [Ibid](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1921/apr/21.htm)_

Notice how Lenin states the alternative of the NEP, fighting against capitalism is "suicidal" in their situation due to the above two points, Neither of which exist in China, Which _can and should_ use the most "correct" policy due to being _far beyond just the first stage of electrification._
Which brings me to my next point:

4) Electrification - **the** most underrated factor in play.
> Is an immediate transition to socialism from the state of affairs predominating in Russia conceivable? Yes, it is, to a certain degree, but on one condition, the precise nature of which we now know thanks to a great piece of scientific work that has been completed. It is electrification. If we construct scores of district electric power stations (we now know where and how these can and should be constructed), and transmit electric power to every village, if we obtain a sufficient number of electric motors and other machinery, we shall not need, or shall hardly need, any transition stages or intermediary links between patriarchalism and socialism. But we know perfectly well that it will take at least ten years only to complete the first stage of this “one” condition; this period can be conceivably reduced only if the proletarian revolution is victorious in such countries as Britain, Germany or the U.S.A.

-_**Lenin**, [Ibid](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1921/apr/21.htm)_

Stating clearly as day that the transition would be sharp and sudden _if only they had electricity_ was the thing that originally convinced me the NEP was necessary. It showed just how backwards, Just how hard the situation was in Post revolution, Pre-USSR Russia.  
Between these, The civil war, The invasions, World war 1, The famine and the SRs and Mensheviks fighting against soviet power one can understand the NEP in its historical context.
If tiny Albania could move to Socialism with much less wealth or technology, Without cutting edge supercomputers and modern nuclear power plants, Why can't modern China?

Besides, How long did the NEP take(Around 7 years, 4 of war and 3 of peace) compared to the Chinese reforms? I would justify 5 years of NEP peace, 7 years, 10 years - Hell, Even 15 I could _somehow_ understand. But even if we ignore Mao completely Dengs reforms have been in place for over **fourty years.**
