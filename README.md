**Only join if Marxist-Leninist or sympathizer**

__Welcome to the Red Spectre__

The Red Spectre is a Marxist-Leninist (Stalinist/Hoxhaist) Server that is compact and doesn't have any redundant features.
We are a polite and welcoming community that makes sure that each and every one of our members has the security of spending time in a safe environment.

We have our own Marxist-Leninist Library with pieces of literature not found anywhere else.

We don't have a dehumanizing and unnecessary formulary that you have to fill out, in order to join the server. You're a human being, not a prisoner of war undergoing an interrogation.

Last but not least, we have a moderated questions and answers section on our server where non-educated answers will get deleted, so that all people that are new to Marxism can make sure to not pick up any false information.

Join if you're tired of shitholes full of Anti-Bolshevism.
