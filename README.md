𝐄𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐇𝐨𝐱𝐡𝐚 𝐒𝐨𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐭𝐲

Welcome to the 𝙴𝚗𝚟𝚎𝚛 𝙷𝚘𝚡𝚑𝚊 𝚂𝚘𝚌𝚒𝚎𝚝𝚢.

⎯⎯★⎯⎯☆⎯⎯★⎯⎯

We are a community of Marxist-Leninists from around the world 
and our goal is to study and to propagate the scientific world-view of Marxism-Leninism.

We collectively study and learn from the teachings of our four 
classics, whom are Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin and 
Joseph Stalin. Additionally, we learn from other Marxist Leninist 
thinkers such as Georgi Dimitrov, Harry Haywood or Enver Hoxha.

⎯⎯★⎯⎯☆⎯⎯★⎯⎯

We sympathise with the International Conference of Marxist-
Leninist Parties and Organisations (CIPOML). However, we are not 
officially affiliated with them.

The 𝙴𝚗𝚟𝚎𝚛 𝙷𝚘𝚡𝚑𝚊 𝚂𝚘𝚌𝚒𝚎𝚝𝚢 is a supportive society to people whom are 
oppressed for their individual identities such as different racial and 
ethnic groups, or people from the LGBT-spectrum.

⎯⎯★⎯⎯☆⎯⎯★⎯⎯

We are absolutely intolerant towards intolerant individuals such as 
Fascists and racists.

We hope to create a platform for discussing Marxism-Leninism, in 
which we learn to combat anti-Communism and at the same time to 
provide practical education on how to be an active Communist.

We hope to have you welcome in the 𝙴𝚗𝚟𝚎𝚛 𝙷𝚘𝚡𝚑𝚊 𝚂𝚘𝚌𝚒𝚎𝚝𝚢.

Hopefully this invitation has given you an incentive, to come and take a look.
