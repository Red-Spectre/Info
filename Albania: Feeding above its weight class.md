# Albania: Feeding above its weight class   

This short article is meant to elucidate the food situation in Socialist Albania. Today is a sad day to be a Liberal, as the proponents of "Socialism is when no food" prove "Anticommunism is when denying reality".

## Socialism fed the people
Firstly, the [statistics for Albania](http://www.instat.gov.al/media/6230/vjetari-statistikor-i-shqiperise-1991_.pdf):

(P138)   
For the average person, these numbers alone are meaningless. Lets make sense of them.
In these statistics, inequality is not taken into account. Neither is the quality of the food, with fast food being rich in calories but unhealthy, giving a "statistical edge" to developed Capitalist countries, especially over Socialist ones.
Despite this, Albania beats Japan, and compares to Spain.

This is despite the fact Albania is tiny, [and 75% of its land are mountains](http://www.enverhoxha.ru/Archive_of_books/Archive/albania_general_information_1984_eng.pdf?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=iw&_x_tr_pto=wapp&_x_tr_sch=http).

Despite these countries being more developed, bigger, and more suited for agriculture then Albania they tiny state had similar and often better ranking.

Countries in 1979-1980 | Albania | Netherlands | Spain | Japan

Calories per day | 3019 | 3110 | 3049 | 2807


## Socialism fed the people ***well***
Let us again reference the Albanian food situation:

Take a look at the tab on total proteins. A citizen of Socialist Albania enjoyed more daily proteins then their U.K. counterpart!
In 1970, an Albanian could expect more proteins then a Dane...in 1984.

The inclusion of this material here, while not directly relevant, shows a lovely picture of agricultural (re)construction.
